we need feature engineering to tranform the columns data when the data is very high and low

in standadiation
the formula of transform the column is:

                  X(i) = X(i)-X(bar)/ sigma

                  X(i)= your coumn value
                  X(bar)= your mean of that column
                  sigma= stamndard deviation


    After tranfromation whole column the standard deviation and mean are always is (1,0)
